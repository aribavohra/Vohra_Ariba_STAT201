    "    - Must be an HTML file rendered using Quarto. \n",
    "    - There aren’t excessively long outputs of extraneous information (e.g. no printouts of unnecessary results without good reason, there aren’t long printouts of which iteration a loop is on, there aren’t long sections of commented-out code, etc.). There is no piece of unnecessary / redundant code, and no unnecessary / redundant text\n",
    "    - The code follows the [python style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for naming variables, spaces, indentation, etc.\n",
    "    - The code should be commented and clearly written with intuitive variable names. For example, use variable names such as number_input, factor, hours, instead of a,b,xyz, etc."
